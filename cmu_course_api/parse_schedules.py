Parses scheduling information from the Schedule Of Classes for a
    given school quarter and year

for reference, here is what each column number refers to in the raw HTML
0: COURSE i.e. '15122'
1: TITLE i.e. 'Principles of Imperative Computation'
2: UNITS i.e. '10.0'
3: LEC/SEC i.e. 'Lec 1', 'M'
4: DAYS i.e. 'TR'
5: BEGIN i.e. '09:00AM'
6: END i.e. '10:20AM'
7: BUILDING/ROOM i.e. 'DH 2210'
8: LOCATION i.e. 'Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania'
9: INSTRUCTOR i.e. 'Simmons, Wright'

It's hard to determine what is a lecture and what is a section/recitation.
After extended examination of course data and how it shows up in SIO, I have
found two main types of courses: letter-lectures and ... non-letter-lectures.

Non-letter-lectures are courses like 15-122 (Principles of Imperative
Computation) or 80-180 (Nature of Language). The course has large central
meeting(s) that a large portion of the students attend (the lectures) each of
which are separated into sections (usually denoted with letters). The
lectures themselves are denoted with something like 'Lec' or 'Lec 1' or 'W'
(for a Qatar lecture). Sometimes they are even denoted with numbers.

Letter-lectures are courses like 21-295 (Putnam Seminar) or 15-295
(Competition Programming and Problem Solving). These are courses without large
central meetings that opt instead for a division into smaller (but still
significant) lettered groups. Because typically each group is taught by an
instructor and not by a TA, I call these lettered groups 'lectures'. Courses
meant for only certain majors, like advanced physics courses, have only one
lettered lecture and comprise much of this category of courses.

    CMU doesn't seem to know how to write HTML. I could rant more,
    but that doesn't fix the issue. Here's a list of known issues:
    - The first row following a department name lacks a starting <tr> tag
      (this causes BeautifulSoup to skip over it when finding <tr>'s). Even
      worse, BeautifulSoup gets so confused that each time it happens it ends
      the HTML document there (with a </html> and such) and begins a new one.
    - Some rows don't even have 10 columns (i.e. they leave out the
      instructor column for no good reason). that's just annoying to parse.
    - Some rows decide to split everything into two rows JUST 'CAUSE THEY CAN.
      To be more specific, it looks like the course title is split into two.
      SIO's behavior appears to be just using the second line.
    - Some rows are empty except for the course title, sometimes appended with
      a colon. Not sure what's up with that, but it adds nonsense meetings to
      the previous section.
